# Project: Food & Beverage Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

This project is focused on analyzing sales data and providing insights for a fictitious e-commerce (Food and Beverage)Company using the Power Bi tool to clean, transform and visualize its dataset.

### Case study: 
Lilo Foods and Beverages provides its customers with a range of services, including sales of food products and drinks. As part of its commitment to improving customer experience and optimizing its operations. I have analyzed its sales data and provide a report/dashboard that provides insights into the business questions.

### About the dataset:
The dataset provided has one fact table(sales data)which contains all the quantitative information and also has 260,097 rows and 11 columns and a dimension table (product data) which stores attributes that describe the objects in a fact table and has 798 rows and 4 columns. You can download the practice dataset from this repository.
